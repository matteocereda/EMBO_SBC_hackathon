Wellcome to the EMBO "The Spatial Biology of Cancer" workshop repository containing codes and information needed to enjoy our Hackathon.

# Useful information to get ready for the Hackathon

•	The Hackathon is based on R programming language. Please make sure to use ``R`` version ≥4.4.0.

•	Please download all the needed packages and datasets on your machine prior to the workshop start. 
  -  Required packages are listed in the ``00_depencencies.html`` file
  -  Required datasets are in the ``input`` folder
  Data are already available for download, and we suggest you get everything on your machine asap.

•	The hackathon is divided into two independent Levels. We aim to discuss the results of Level 1 after around 1,5 hours, while results of Level 2 will be discussed at the end.

•	There will be people to assist you although you should have all the needed expertise within your groups already.

•	There will be questions associated to the two Levels and each group (see formation of groups below) will be asked to send an email (one per group) with the answers to the organisers, maximum by 2nd of September, noon. The best group will be revealed at the end of the workshop.

# On site participants

•	At the registration desk please choose a coloured dot sticker that best represents your background:
  -  Green : biologist
  -  Yellow : bioinformatician
  -  Blue : quantitative scientist (mathematician; physicist; statistician; *etc.*)
  -  Red : clinical scientist

Place your sticker on the conference badge and find other 8 or 9 people (each group will be formed of 9 or 10 people) with diverse background. The more diverse and colour-balanced the group is, the better.

•	``Groups need to be formed before the Hackathon starts``. Pick a nickname and a representative of the group. The team representative will be in charge of sending the answers to the organisers.

•	Please ``bring your own, fully charged, laptop`` because no computers will be provided on site and not many power plugs will be available.

# Virtual participants

We will assign you randomly in virtual rooms, each with about 10 participants. Please nominate a team representative, who will be in charge of sending the answers to the organisers.

•	Hackathon will follow the same rules as for on-site participants

•	There will be an assistant for helping you online
